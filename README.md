Code repository for our paper "Augmentation Strategies for an Imbalanced Learning Problem on a novel COVID-19 Severity Dataset". This paper introduces a novel COVID-19 severity dataset for the COVID-19 positive images from the COVIDx8B dataset by [Linda Wang et al.](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net). The labels can be found in **COVIDx8B_severity_mapping.csv**. Our training and evaluation scripts can be found in **source/**.
